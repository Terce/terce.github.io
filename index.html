					<h1 class="titlebox">Audience:</h1>
					<ul>
						<li>Doctors that need to prescript a drug to their patients</li>
						<li>Patients who have a drug prescription.</li>
						<li>Pharmacists who need a prescription in order to sell the patient a drug.</li>
					</ul>
					<h1 class="titlebox">Functionality:</h1>
					<p>Our web page has two parts:</p>
					<p>The first part consists of a login page, here you are presented with
						 several options at the top where you can access other web pages, 
						 in the middle you will find an image and two forms that need to be 
						 filled in order to have access to your prescription. The first form will 
						 ask your full name, once this is complete you will have to type your 
						 password.
					</p>
					<p>Once this process is complete you will be able to access your prescription, 
						on the left you will find your diagnose and the drugs that you can 
						use to treat your condition. On the right you will find the date of
						 the prescription, your name, the name of your doctor and your medical
						  history.
					</p>
					<p>To use the prescription you will need to go to a drug store where the pharmacist
						 will be able to check your prescription, give you the drugs you need and mark
						  the prescription as used.
					</p>
					<p>On the top right corner you will have a button to log-out of your account,
						 in your medical history you will be able to see the date and the prescriptions
						  you have received during the last year.</p>
					<h1 class="titlebox">Why?</h1>
					<p>To use the prescription you will need to go to a pharmacy where the pharmacist
						 will be able to check your prescription, give you the drugs you need and mark
						  the prescription as used.</p>
					<h1 class="titlebox">Problems to Solve:</h1>
					<p>By making them electronic, you avoid the possibilities of losing and forgetting
						 the prescrption or not being able to tell what does it say, you can also access it
						  almost anywhere.</p>
